# NL_RNN

NL RNN is a recurring neural network (RNN) that learns the evolution of optical pulses through nonlinear media. NL RNN is trained with data sets generated using [PyNLO](https://github.com/pyNLO/PyNLO). This project is heavily inspired by [Salmela, et al., Nature Machine Intelligence, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-021-00297-z).
